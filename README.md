This project involves the application of machine learning algorithms to classify images from a subset of the CIFAR-100 dataset. The CIFAR-100 dataset consists of 100 different object categories, with each category containing 500 training images and 100 testing images. The primary objective is to train models using these images and evaluate their performance on the test set. This project demonstrates practical skills in image processing, feature extraction, and machine learning, combined with theoretical knowledge acquired throughout the course.
